# ShakyTextGenerator
This contains the .exe and source code for my shaky font generator

This program will ask the user for:
-What the new shaky font should be called
-Which base image to use
-Are there any sub-folders within minecraft:font to be used, and if so, what are their names
-What do you want the ascent of this font to be
-Which character should be used to call this shaky font

It will then display the command for showing the shaky font in world, 
after the user puts the <name>.png and the <name>.json in their resource pack.
  
Anyone who uses this program should have a basic idea about how fonts work. Or not, good luck either way.
